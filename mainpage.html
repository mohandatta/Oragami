        <center>Origami (折り紙, Japanese pronunciation: [oɾiɡami] or [oɾiꜜɡami], from ori meaning "folding",<br> and kami meaning "paper" (kami changes to gami due to rendaku))<br> is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture.<br> In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as an inclusive term <br>for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin.<br> The goal is to transform a flat square sheet of paper into a finished sculpture through<br> folding and sculpting techniques. Modern origami practitioners generally discourage<br> the use of cuts, glue, or markings on the paper. Origami folders often use the Japanese<br> word kirigami to refer to designs which use cuts.<br><br><br>

        Do you know!!!<br><br><br>
        1) There are two types of camels: One humped or<br> “dromedary” camels and two humped Bactrian camels.<br><br><br>
        2) Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows<br>of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.<br><br><br>
        3) Camels have thick lips which let them forage for<br> thorny plants other animals can't eat.<br><br><br>
        teddy-bear <a href="http://origami.me/teddy-bear/"><img src="images/teddy.png" width=150 height=150></a><br><br>
        Do you know!!!<br><br><br>
        - Teddy bears got their name from the story that Teddy Roosevelt<br> refused to shoot a bear cub while on a hunting trip in 1902.<br><br><br>

        - The first toy stuffed bear was created by German toymaker Margarete <br>Steiff. She created a soft plush with movable arms and legs and a<br> friendly face after taking her nephew to the zoo in 1903.<br><br><br>

        - The Oxford English Dictionary dates the first use of the term teddy<br> bear to 1906.<br><br><br>
        cicada <a href="http://origami.me/cicada/"><img src="images/cicada.png" width=150 height=150></a><br><br>
        Do you know!!!!!!<br><br>
        1. Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs.<br> They are about the size of a grain of rice <br> when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging.<br> <br><br><br>

        2. The loud whirring or buzzing sound you hear is an <br> all-male cicada chorus. (Females make a much quieter<br>  sound by flicking their wings.) Cicadas don’t sing at night,<br> so don’t blame them if you can’t sleep.<br><br><br><br>
        
        3. They’re true bugs (from the order Hemiptera).<br> So you can call them a bug and be scientifically accurate.<br><br><br>

         Do you know!!!<br><br><br>
         1) Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. They are one of only<br> a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a <br>test of self recognition. They can also recognise each letter of the human alphabet, <br>differentiate between photographs, and<br> even distinguish different humans within a photograph.<br><br><br>
         2) Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities. They use <br>a range of skills, such as using the sun as a guide and an<br> internal ‘magnetic compass’. A study at Oxford University found that they will also<br> use landmarks as signposts and will <br>travel along man-made roads and motorways, even changing direction at junctions.<br><br><br>
         chameleon <a href="http://origami.me/chameleon/"><img src="images/chameleon.png" width=150 height=150></a><br><br>
         Do you know!!!<br><br><br>
         A lot of people think chameleons change their colour based on their surroundings<br> – sort of like camouflage. However, this isn’t true.<br><br><br>

         Chameleons actually change their colour due to a number of different factors, including<br> their mood, changes in light or temperature, or the humidity of their environment.<br><br><br>
         
         Different chameleons will also have different colours. For instance, more dominant, attractive<br> males will have brighter colours, and submissive males may be darker browns and greys.<br> Women will change their colours based on whether they want to accept or reject a suitor.<br><br><br>
         panda <a href="http://origami.me/panda/"><img src="images/panda.png" width=150 height=150></a><br><br>
         Do you know!!!<br><br><br>
         1. Giant pandas (often referred to as simply “pandas”) are black and white<br> bears. In the wild, they are found in thick bamboo forests, high up<br>in the mountains of central China – you can check out our cool<br><br><br>

         2. These magnificent mammals are omnivores. But whilst pandas will occasionally<br> eat small animals and fish, bamboo counts for 99 percent of their diet.<br><br><br>

         3. Pandas are BIG eaters – every day they fill their tummies for up to 12 hours,<br> shifting up to 12 kilograms of bamboo!<br><br><br>

         4. The giant panda’s scientific name is Ailuropoda melanoleuca, which means “black and white cat-foot”.<br><br><br>
